        <p>The aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points, achieved (usually over several rounds of play) by being the first to play all of one's own cards and scoring points for the cards still held by the other players.
         The 2018 edition of the game consists of 112 cards: 25 in each of four color suits (red, yellow, green, blue), each suit consisting of one zero, two each of 1 through 9, and two each of the action cards "Skip", "Draw Two", and "Reverse". The deck also contains four "Wild" cards, four "Wild Draw Four", one "Wild Shuffle Hands" and three "Wild Customizable".[2] Sets manufactured prior to 2018 do not contain these last two types of Wild cards, for a total of 108 cards in the deck.[6]
        For each hand, a dealer is determined by having each player randomly draw one card from the deck. The player with the highest number card deals, and all cards are reshuffled into the deck to begin the dealing.
         To start a hand, seven cards are dealt to each player, and the top card of the remaining deck is flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile. The player to the dealer's left plays first unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or Wild card (see below). On a player's turn, they must do one of the following:
        play one card matching the discard in color, number, or symbol
        play a Wild card, or a Wild Draw Four card if allowed to (see restrictions below)
        draw the top card from the deck, and optionally play it if possible
         Cards are played by laying them face-up on top of the discard pile. Play initially proceeds clockwise around the table.</p>
